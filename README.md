# Create Token Distributors

This is a UI to interact with the Solana-NFT-Claim-Tokens Program (https://github.com/willp11/Solana-NFT-Claim-Tokens).

Create token distributors to distribute tokens to holders of a specified NFT project.

Can be used to distribute airdrops to NFT projects. 
The distributor specifies the token to be airdropped and the NFT collection (identified by the NFT symbol and creator).
The tokens to be airdropped are locked up in an escrow account.
When the distribution period starts, holders of holders of the NFT collection can claim tokens from the escrow account.
